## Note on Using react-quill-new**

This project temporarily uses the `react-quill-new` package instead of the official `react-quill` due to unresolved issues in the latter, specifically related to deprecated `findDOMNode` usage. Once the official `react-quill` package is updated and stable, we plan to revert to it.
